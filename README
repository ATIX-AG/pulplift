# Pulplift

This is based on and makes use of the Vagrant based configuration of the [Forklift](https://github.com/theforeman/forklift) project. Please see the Forklift documentation for all configuration options available when creating custom or adding new boxes.

## Available Boxes

The aim is to provide every supported OS and major installation type combination for Pulp 3 based upon what is available from [ansible-pulp3](https://github.com/pulp/ansible-pulp3). The currently supported boxes:

```
