# Pulplift

This is based on and makes use of the Vagrant based configuration of the
[Forklift](https://github.com/theforeman/forklift) project. Please see the Forklift documentation
for all configuration options available when creating custom boxes.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.5+
- Vagrant 1.8+
- Vagrant provider plugin (follow [vagrant](
  https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/installation.html) instructions)
  - libvirt and virtualbox supported
- Enabled virtualization in BIOS

## Setup

Before using Pulplift, ensure that all submodules are updated and in place.

```
git submodule update --init
```

After your git submodules are installed, you can then use ``vagrant up <box-name>`` to create a Pulp
environment. See the list of available boxes below.

## Setting up a dev environment

After you've set up the git submodules as outlined in the Setup section, you will need to [clone
the source code](https://docs.pulpproject.org/en/3.0/nightly/contributing/dev-setup.html#get-the-source).

You can then spin up your development environment with the following ``vagrant`` command. If you
have any custom configuration options **including plugin choice**, see "Configuration" section
below.

```
vagrant up pulp3-source-fedora28
```

## Available Boxes

The aim is to provide every supported OS and major installation type combination for Pulp 3 based
upon what is available from [ansible-pulp](https://github.com/pulp/ansible-pulp). The currently
supported boxes:

```
centos7                            not created (libvirt)
centos7-fips                       not created (libvirt)
debian10                           not created (libvirt)
fedora28                           not created (libvirt)
fedora29                           not created (libvirt)
fedora30                           not created (libvirt)
pulp2-nightly-pulp3-source-centos7 not created (libvirt)
pulp3-sandbox-centos7              not created (libvirt)
pulp3-sandbox-centos7-fips         not created (libvirt)
pulp3-sandbox-debian10             not created (libvirt)
pulp3-sandbox-fedora28             not created (libvirt)
pulp3-sandbox-fedora29             not created (libvirt)
pulp3-sandbox-fedora30             not created (libvirt)
pulp3-source-centos7               not created (libvirt)
pulp3-source-centos7-fips          not created (libvirt)
pulp3-source-debian10              not created (libvirt)
pulp3-source-fedora28              not created (libvirt)
pulp3-source-fedora29              not created (libvirt)
pulp3-source-fedora30              not created (libvirt)
```

#### Base Boxes

The base OS boxes, such as centos7, can be used to spin-up a clean environment.

```
vagrant up centos7
```

## Ansible

Any of the `pulp3` labeled boxes will both spin-up and provision the labeled Ansible installation
scenario for Pulp 3.

#### Configuration

Each box uses a playbook appropriate for the type of installation specified in the box name.
Additional ansible variables are defined in ``example.dev-config.yml`` and
``example.user-config.yml``. If you need to change these variables, **including choosing which
plugins to install**, copy one of these files to **create a local variable file**. Pulplift will
look for ``local.dev-config.yml`` or ``local.user-config.yml``, which are not checked into git.

Any of the Ansible variables can be set in this local variable file. Please see the README of each
[ansible-pulp](https://github.com/pulp/ansible-pulp#pulp-3-ansible-installer) role for more
detailed information.

#### Running a playbook directly

You can run an existing or custom playbook directly using `ansible-playbook`. For example:

```
vagrant up centos7
ansible-playbook my-pulp-install.yaml -l centos7
```
